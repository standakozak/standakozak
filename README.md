## My projects
### Geospatial libraries
I've written a [seminary paper (in Czech)](https://github.com/standakozak/Seminarni-prace-geopandas) on a Python geospatial library Geopandas for my high school's Geography lessons. I've also contributed several times to this library on GitHub.

### Ticket booking system
I've made a [web app](https://github.com/standakozak/ticketsbooking) for booking ticket to our school's annual prom. This website was used by more than 300 people.
